Build anything that is useful to an educational institute. 
You are challenged to identify a real-world problem or opportunity within an educational 
institute and develop a digital solution that addresses it. While learning platforms are a 
common choice, educational institutes are complex ecosystems with diverse needs. Your 
solution can target any aspect of campus life, operations, or student/staff experience. 
Inspiration: Areas to Explore 
● Hostels: 
Room allocation systems, complaint management, visitor logs, maintenance 
requests, or digital notice boards. 
● Canteens: 
Pre-ordering food, digital menus, feedback systems, waste tracking, or 
nutrition planning. 
● Libraries: 
Book tracking, digital lending, seat reservation, overdue notifications, or 
recommendation engines. 
● Registration Desks: 
Streamlined student onboarding, event registration, document management, 
or grievance redressal. 
● Attendance: 
Digital attendance systems, analytics dashboards for teachers, or attendance 
notifications for students. 
● Landing Pages: 
Create engaging, informative landing pages for new courses, events, or 
clubs-especially if your team is focused on frontend development. 
Your project can be frontend, backend, or full-stack. 
Focus on solving a genuine problem or adding significant value to the campus 
community. 
Submission Requirements 
● GitHub Repository: 
○ All code must be pushed to a public GitHub repo by the end of the 7-hour 
hackathon. 
○ Include a README with clear setup and usage instructions. 
● Deployment: 
○ Your project must be deployed and accessible on Vercel, Netlify, or an 
equivalent platform. 
● Google Form: 
○ Fill this google form with all the project details - GoogleForm 
Tips for Teams 
● Think beyond e-learning. Explore administrative, logistical, or social aspects of 
campus life. 
● Focus on building a working prototype, not a perfect product. 
● Use frameworks, libraries, and AI tools to accelerate development, but ensure all 
work is done during the hackathon. 
Summary 
Your mission: 
Build any digital solution-web app or mobile app, tool, dashboard, or platform-that 
solves a problem or adds value to any part of an educational institute. From hostels 
to canteens, from libraries to landing pages, the possibilities are wide open. Be 
creative, be practical, and make something that could genuinely help your campus 
community.
